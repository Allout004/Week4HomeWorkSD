# Week 4 Homework Quiz

This is a quiz about what we have learned the past weeks and showing that we can use what we have learned.

I dont understand for loops and arrays and objects and how they interact with for loops because i know i could have made this code about 100 or so lines shorter with the use of for loops. Reaching out to a tutor some time this week as I was hoping I would understand it but I do not.

Will be redoing this project once I figure out how to ustalize for loops. Also left lots of my old code of me trying to get it to work and then just going a differenet route.
